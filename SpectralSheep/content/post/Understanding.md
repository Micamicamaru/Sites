#Understand the Landscapre

The world is an interesting place, many things move with out us and go their own way. Thigns that seemed to make sense , follow up with more nonsense and blame. Do we not know what we want. we wander aimless calling to a void to answer. To give us meaning. In the end only a few lucky people hear the calling. From the void it pulls their soul forward. If you are like me, then the void never answered. But that doesn't it hasnt sent signs to me. Or you.

The mind works towards you goals whether you want it to or not. When you state and imagine your goals, your mind will help you along the way. Sending you signals and things to get you along.
